# ML-KNN-Iris-Digites

A comprehensive project demonstrating the classic K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm applied to both the Iris and Digits datasets. This repository provides a full walkthrough of the machine learning workflow, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook and leverages popular data science libraries.

## Project Overview

This repository applies the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to the Iris and Digits datasets for classification tasks. The workflow covers:
- Loading and exploring the datasets
- Preprocessing and feature engineering
- Splitting the data into train and test sets
- Model training and hyperparameter selection
- Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualization of results

*Image 1: KNN Pipeline Overview*

**Workflow Steps:**
1. Import Libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
2. Load Dataset (Iris/Digits from scikit-learn or CSV)
3. Explore Data (shape, missing values, samples)
4. Preprocess Data (Optional normalization)
5. Split Data (Train-test split)
6. Train Model (Initialize and train KNN classifier, choose k)
7. Evaluate Model (Predict labels, accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)
8. Visualize Results (confusion matrix, scatter plots, heatmaps)
